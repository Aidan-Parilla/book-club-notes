## The Psychology of Modern Leftism

"When we speak of leftists in this article we have in mind mainly socialists, collectivists, 
'politically correct' types, feminists, gay and disability activists, animal rights
activists and the like."

## Feelings of Inferiority

According to Ted, most modern leftists have typical feelings of low-esteem, powerlessness,
etc.

* "Hypersensitivity" to language that _designates_ minorities or concerns minorities
* Political correctness is usually associated and pedaled by university professors,
of whom have no real motivation to be "politically correct"
(Probably Ted is malding about his professorship)
* "Intense identification" with the problems of groups that are perceived as weak
* Leftists hate "rationality" ... they hate the West purely because the West is strong
and successful
* Leftists hate competition because "deep inside, he feels like a loser"
* The leftist "hates science and rationality" ...
* Leftists use nonviolence because they "prefer masochistic tactics"

"If our society had no social problems at all, the leftists would have to invent
problems in order to provide themselves with an excuse for making a fuss" - lol

## Oversocialization

* Leftists deceive themselves to avoid feelings of guilt for their emotions
* This guy sure loves affirmative action ...
* "We are even told by experts how to eat, how to exercise, how to make love, how
to raise our kids and so forth" - lowkey he kinda ate with that one

## The Power Process

Power is not enough - humans want "effort" and "attainment of goal" and
sometimes "autonomy"

Regardless of whether the goals are physical necessities or not, nonattainment of
important goals produces frustrations.

## Surrogate activities

Surrogate activities are activities that are "directed toward and artificial goal that
people set up for themselves merely in order to have some goal to work toward" - 
including scientific work, atheltic achievement, humanitarian work, artistic and literary
creation, climbing the corporate ladder, acquisition of money and material goods, and
social activism.

People do not satisfy their biological needs _autonomously_

## Autonomy

Without autonomy, you get "abnormal sexual behavior" ... 

## Sources of social problems

```
Transexuality was fairly common among some of the American Indian tribes
```

huh

```
Among the abnormal conditions present in modern industrial society are excessive density
of population, isolation of man from nature, excessive rapidity of social change and the
breakdown of small scale communities such as the extended family, the village or the tribe
```

lowkey he is spitting with this one.

``` People who want peace and quiet are frustrated by the noise ```

yeah I agree with you there man

``` 
A technological society HAS TO weaken family ties and local communities if it is to function efficiently 
```

I feel this one I've always wondered why we have to move so far away... 

On pioneers - "One may well question whether the creation of this community was an improvement, but at
any rate it staisfied the pioneer's need for the power process" - lets go back to farm communities
